# Community Strategies

This repository contains community-created strategies for the Python Strategy Editor of the margin
application found at [margin.io]().

This package is available for Python 3.6 or higher through pip

pip install margin-community-strategies
```

If you want to write your own strategies, we recommend installing the strategy SDK from
https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/strategy-sdk or using pip
```
pip install margin-strategy-sdk
```
and start by cloning the template strategy from
https://github.com/MarginOpenSource/strategy-template.
